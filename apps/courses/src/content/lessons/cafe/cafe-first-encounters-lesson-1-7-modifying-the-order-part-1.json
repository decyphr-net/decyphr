  "markdown": "\n# Modifying The Order Part 1\n\nCongrats on completing your very first conversation and purchase out in the real world!\n\nNow, are things always that simple? Unfortunately not! There are a number of things that could go wrong in this interaction. After receiving the order and looking at the table with the milk they might think \"oh, I don't see any oat milk there\" and request it.\n\nNo worries at all, lets look at how they might ask that:\n\n- customer\n> I ndáiríre, an bhfuil bainne coirce agaibh?  \n> In NAW-ree-reh, un will BAN-yuh KIR-keh uh-gwiv?  \n> Actually, do you have oat milk?  \n\n- barista\n> Tá, ach tá fiche cent breise air.  \n> Taw, akh taw FI-heh sent BRESH-eh air.  \n> Yes, but it's 20 cent extra  \n\nLet’s look at what’s happening here.\n`I ndáiríre` can mean \"really/seriously/actually\".\n\nAfter that, we want to ask if they have the oat milk. We've seen already that `bainne` is \"milk\" and the Irish word for \"oat\" is `coirce` so that gives us `bainne coirce`.\n\n`An bhfuil X agaibh?` is a really useful phrase you can use in lots of places. It simply means “Do you have X?” You’ll get used to seeing this pattern over time.\n\n`Tá` is the positive answer to `an bhfuil`. Treat it as \"yes\" in this case. `Ach` simply means \"but\" and `fiche cent` means \"twenty cent\" and `breise` means \"extra\". Lastly is the `air`. Literally this means \"on\", so basically what we're saying here is \"there's an extra twenty cent on it\".\n\nNow, after being informed of the extra cost, the customer needs to decide if they're willing to pay the extra 20 cent, or leave it as is. Firstly, we'll look at the positive answer:\n\n- customer\n> Cinnte! Seo duit!  \n> KIN-cheh! Sho gwich!  \n> Of course! Here you go!  \n\nThis now indicates that the customer is fine with the extra charge. `Cinnte` is a positive affirmation like \"sure/of course\". Of course, the `seo duit` here implies that the customer is in the process of handing over the money.\n\nIf they decide that they don't want it, they can say:\n\n- customer\n> Sin ceart go leor  \n> Shin kyart guh lor.  \n> That's fine  \n\n`Ceart go leor` is the Irish for \"OK\" or \"fine\". In text speak, you'll often see this abbreviated as `cgl`. This works as a polite refusal in the sense of \"ah, that's OK then\" in Irish English.\n",

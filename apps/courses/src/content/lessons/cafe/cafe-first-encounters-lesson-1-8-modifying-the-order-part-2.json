Let's take a look at another case where a problem arises.\n\n- customer\n> I ndáiríre, an bhfuil bainne coirce agaibh?  \n> In NAW-ree-reh, un will BAN-yuh KIR-keh uh-gwiv?  \n> Actually, do you have oat milk?  \n\n- barista\n> Faroar, níl bainne coirce againn inniu. Ach, tá bainne almóinn nó bainne soighe againn  \n> FAR-oar, neel BAN-yuh KIR-keh ah-gwin in-YOO. Akh, taw BAN-yuh al-MOAN noh BAN-yuh SOY-eh ah-gwin.  \n> Unfortunately, we don't have oat milk today. But, we do have almond or soy milk  \n\nIn this case, there's no oat milk available, so the barista informs the customer. `Faroar` simply means \"unfortunately\". Another word that you might hear instead is `drochuair`. Next up we have `níl bainne coirce againn`. Earlier, we saw `tá` used to say “yes” to `an bhfuil…?`  Here, we use `níl` to say “no”.\n\nYou’ll notice the pattern again:\n- `An bhfuil X agaibh?` – Do you have X?\n- `Tá X againn` – We have X.\n- `Níl X againn` – We don’t have X.\n\nThis pattern will come up again and again in real-life situations.\n\nAnd lastly in the first sentence we have `inniu` which simply means \"today\".\n\nIn the next sentence then we inform the customer that we have `bainne almóinn` or `bainne soighe`, which are almond milk and soy milk respectively. Then `nó` is the Irish word for \"or\".\n\nFrom there, the customer has a choice to make again. They can either choose the almond or soy milk, or go ahead without one of those options.\n\n- customer\n> Bainne soighe, le do thoil  \n> BAN-yuh SOY-eh, leh duh hull.  \n> Soy milk, please  \n\n**Or**\n\n- customer\n> Bainne almóinn, le do thoil  \n> BAN-yuh al-MOAN, leh duh hull.  \n> Almond milk, please  \n\nDepending on their choice, of course!\n\nAnd if they choose to go ahead without, then, just like the last example, they can say:\n\n- customer\n> Sin ceart go leor  \n> Shin kyart guh lor.  \n> That's fine  \n\nYou've now managed to navigate your second ordering crisis! Congratulations!\n",
